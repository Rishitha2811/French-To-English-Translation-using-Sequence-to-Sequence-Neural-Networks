# French-to-English-Translation-using-Seq-to-Seq-Neural-Networks
This project demonstrates a sequence-to-sequence neural network implementation for translating French sentences into English. The approach leverages advanced NLP techniques, such as **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** and **attention mechanisms**, to achieve accurate translation.

## Introduction

Language translation is a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project uses a neural network-based approach to build a French-to-English translator. It includes:
- Sequence-to-sequence modeling with encoder-decoder architecture.
- Attention mechanisms for context-aware translations.

## Features
- Trainable model for French-to-English translations.
- Preprocessed dataset with tokenized sentences.
- Visualization of attention weights.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishitha2811/your-repository.git
   
## Usage
- Train the model: python train.py --epochs 50 --batch-size 64
- Evaluate the model: python evaluate.py
- Perform translations: python translate.py --input "Bonjour tout le monde"
  
## Dataset
The dataset includes parallel French-English sentence pairs. For more details, check the data/ directory

## Results
- Achieved a BLEU score of 35.6 on the test set.
Examples of translations:
- French: Bonjour tout le monde
- English (Predicted): Hello everyone
